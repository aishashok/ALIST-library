# ALIST-library of spectral templates.

Using the SDSS-IV/APOGEE stars from their latest DR16 data, we generate a new empirical stellar library to generate a new high-resolution, NIR SSP spectral model library. We genrate this library using 2 different isochrones: Padova-based and MIST-based. 

More information on where to find the models and how to access it is given in 'SSPmodels_info'
